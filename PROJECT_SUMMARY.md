# 🌍🤖 AI for Sustainable Development: Flash Flood Risk Prediction
## Complete Project Summary

**Date:** July 27, 2025  
**SDG Focus:** SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)  
**Theme:** "Machine Learning Meets the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This comprehensive AI project addresses critical sustainability challenges by developing a machine learning system for localized flash flood risk prediction in small towns. While most flood models focus on major rivers and big cities, this solution specifically targets smaller communities that are often overlooked but equally vulnerable to climate change impacts.

### Problem Statement

Small towns face unique challenges in flood prediction:
- **Limited historical data** compared to major cities
- **Complex terrain interactions** with rainfall patterns
- **Lack of sophisticated monitoring infrastructure**
- **Increasing frequency of extreme weather events** due to climate change

### AI Solution

Our solution combines **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning** approaches:

#### Supervised Learning Components:
- **Random Forest Regression**: Predicts flood risk probability based on multiple environmental factors
- **Gradient Boosting**: Enhances prediction accuracy for extreme weather events
- **Neural Network**: Captures complex non-linear relationships in weather patterns
- **Logistic Regression**: Provides interpretable baseline model

#### Unsupervised Learning Components:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups towns by similar risk profiles and environmental characteristics
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving important features
