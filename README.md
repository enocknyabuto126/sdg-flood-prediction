# 🌍🤖 AI for Sustainable Development: Localized Flash Flood Risk Prediction

## Project Overview

This project addresses **SDG 13 (Climate Action)** and **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)** by developing a machine learning model to predict flash flood risks in small towns. The solution is tailored for smaller communities that are often overlooked but equally vulnerable to climate change impacts.
                                     https://flood-prediction-25.streamlit.app/

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Small towns face unique challenges in flood prediction:
- Limited historical data compared to major cities
- Complex terrain interactions with rainfall patterns
- Lack of sophisticated monitoring infrastructure
- Increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change

## 🧠 AI Solution

Our solution uses **Supervised Learning** models to predict the number of people affected by disasters, using real-world data from SDG indicators.

### Supervised Learning Components:
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regression**
- **Neural Network Regression**
- **Linear Regression**

## 📊 Features Used

- **GeoAreaName**: Name of the geographic area
- **TimePeriod**: Year or time period
- **Source**: Data source
- **Nature**: Nature of the disaster
- **Reporting Type**: Type of reporting

The target variable is **Value**: the number of people affected by disaster.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web dashboard
- **Plotly**: Interactive plots
- **openpyxl**: Excel file support

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Interactive Web Dashboard
```sh
streamlit run src/app.py
```
- Open the link provided in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
- Use the “Predict” tab to upload data and get predictions.
- Use the “Dashboard” tab to view model performance, feature importance, and data visualizations.

### 3. (Optional) Generate Batch Visualizations
If you want to generate all plots and dashboards as files:
```sh
python src/visualize_results.py
```
Check the `results/` folder for output files.

## 🖥️ Interactive Web Dashboard

- **Prediction Tab**: Upload your own Excel data or use the test set to get predictions from the trained model.
- **Dashboard Tab**: View model performance (MAE, RMSE, R²), feature importance, predicted vs actual, affected by area, affected over time, and a sample of the raw data.

## 🌐 Deploying Online

You can deploy this app for free on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud):
1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. Sign in to Streamlit Cloud and create a new app from your repo.
3. Set the main file to `src/app.py`.
4. Add any required secrets or environment variables if needed.

## 📈 Model Performance

Model performance is shown in the dashboard tab after training on your data. Metrics include:
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **R²**: Coefficient of Determination
